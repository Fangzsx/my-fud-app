## Inspiration
This is the first app that I made using the MVVM Architecture. I followed a tutorial but I made some improvisation and my own features.

## Features
1. Instructive- Every meal is detailed starting from its ingredients upto instructional video provide by theMealDB API
2. Recommendation- Generates a random meal
3. Popular Meal- Since I can't pay for the API, I only generate list of meal based on certain category
4. Find meal by Category- User can sort meals based on category they have chosen
5. Save a meal as Favorite- Meal can be saved locally.
6. Browse Meals- User can browse the list of meal available in theMealDB API and show them alphabetically.


## Project Experience
I had a lot of hiccups making this app because MVVM is something new to me. But in the end, I was able to finish finish the project and optimize some part which was not included in the video.
